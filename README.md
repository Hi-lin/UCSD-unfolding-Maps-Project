# Module 6
This project displays earthquakes around the world, airports around the world, and the gpa per capita of the countries to visualize the potential economic effects and effects on travel caused by earthquakes. You can click the airports checkbox at the bottom of the key to show or hide airports.


This project was guided by "https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java" this course on Coursera, and made using the UCSD Unfolding Maps package and World Bank data.
